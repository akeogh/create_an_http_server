    <h1>A Vanilla HTTP Server!</h1>
    <p>Don't be afraid, but... The robots are listening!</p>

      <li><a href="/time">Get the robot time</a>:
        <p>Want to know what time it is... FOR ROBOTS? Well click!</p></li>

      <li><a href="/name">Greetings</a>!
        <p>Be greeted personally by the devils that live in your computer by
        simply adding your name to the end of this link's URL (I bet there are
        cleverer ways I could handle that, but right now, I'm playing!) If you'd
        rather not let them know, just count yourself one of many with a generic
        'hello world!'</p></li>

      <li>Greetings #2!
        <p>I'm not sure how to link this one... But check out my code in the
        command line with superagent, and you can send your name with JSON!
        That's right, robot language!</p></li>
